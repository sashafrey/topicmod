BigARTM FAQ
===========

Can I use BigARTM from other programming languages (not Python)?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, as long as your language has an implementation of Google
Protocol Buffers (the list can be found `here
<https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/wiki/ThirdPartyAddOns>`_).
Note that Google officially supports C++, Python and Java.

The following figure shows how to call BigARTM methods directly
on ``artm.dll`` (Windows) or ``artm.so`` (Linux).
